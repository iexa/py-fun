My python adventures

Small tidbits of code practiced and read/learned from teclado's,
raymond hattinger's and various books and blogposts and other sources:

I use the PDM package manager as it works similar to npm / yarn. It integrates 
nicely with your python (no need to activate virtual envs, it's automatic).

If you use VS code with python, you need to install ipykernel for ipynb files.
Just `pdm install` or create a new virtual env and install it.


* bottle, flask, fastapi, sanic -- easy to use web fws
* major modules like re, path, collections, functools, itertools
* tkinter gui code
* databases, mongoose, sqlalchemy, sqlobject, ponyorm, tortoiseorm, peewee(-async)
